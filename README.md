# BCVTP_DHN_Network_Graz



The key file in this repository is the Modelica package BCVPD_Graz_Test.mo which contains two example cases of a DHN network and is designed to be run in Dymola simulation software. In order to run this package in Dymola, the Annex60 and Buildings v3.0.0 need to be loaded.

The model is a step towards co-simulation between Dymola and other simulation softwares such as IDA-ace and TRNSYS.
